      <h1>Musea: global artwork explorer platform</h1>
      <h2>One place to sum every museum API.</h2>
      <p>Museums are said to be the way to democratize art. Through that logic, anyone should be able to access museums and their art. <b>But we know that to not be true.</b></p>
      <p>We hold a different hope for digital platforms: the digitalization of art and museum archives can lead to further advance the accessibility to them for anyone anywhere in the world. Well done art data bases can change how we learn art history worldwide - <b>Musea's intention</b> is to center them in one place: learn about artists and their work, save the artworks that interest you and explore through our map museums and art centers around you.</p>
